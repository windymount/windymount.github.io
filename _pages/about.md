Hi! I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tsui-wei (Lily) Weng](https://lilywenglab.github.io/). My major research interest is in trustworthy machine learning. I hope to combine **empirical success** of deep networks and **theoretical soundness** of traditional machine learning methods to produce **robust and trustworthy** AI models. My CV could be found [here](files/cv.pdf).
