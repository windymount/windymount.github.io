## Neural network architecture design with ordinary differential equation numerical schemes
My first research project under the advise of Prof. Bin Dong when I was a junior year B.S. student. Following the idea proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10121), a study on how to design network archtecture inspired by ODE numerical algorithms was carried out. For more details, see this [report](/files/Deep network design.pdf).
## Failure probability estimation via Bayesian neural networks
Neural networks could be used as a PDE solver with much lower cost comparing to traditional finite elements methods, which makes them to be a possible kind of model when cheap approximation of PDE solution is needed. In this project I applied Bayesian neural networks as a PDE solution approximator in failure probability estimation. Details could be found in my [B.S. thesis](/files/finalThesis.pdf).
